          <h2> What is Emotional Intelligence</h2>
          <p>The term <cite>Emotional Intelligence</cite> was first coined by two researchers, Salavoy and Mayer, in an article they published in 1990 in the  journal <cite>Imagination, Cognition, and Personality</cite>. It was later further popularized in the 1995 book <cite>Emotional Intelligence</cite> by Dan Goleman. Emotional Intelligence is the ability to perceive, use, manage and handle emotions. This includes recognizing emotions in yourself and in others and then using that to guide your thinking and behavior and to adjust to your environment. The 4 domains of emotional intelligence are 
            <ol>
              <li>Self Awareness</li>
              <li>Self Management</li>
              <li>Social Awareness</li>
              <li>Relationship Management</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
