        <h2>What I've Learned About Myself </h2>
          <p>
            My favorite thing that I have learned during core is to meditate daily. This practice has been really grounding to me as I have gone through the foundations curriculum.What I learned about my ego is that it I wasn't previously aware that I have a tendency to compare myself to others. I think this comparison is born out of fear -fear that I'm falling behind, fear that I'm not doing well or well enough, fear that I won't succeed. I learned that this is a fixed mindset- a need for approval but that through conscious effort and awareness I can cultivate a growth mindset. During core learning and meditation I've noticed that it sometimes brings up uncomfortable emotion sit with yourself and to become aware of your positive qualities as well as negative ones.

        <h2> The Role of Values, Empathy and Self-Awareness</h2>
          <p>The roles of our values, empathy and self-awareness play a big role in our learning. Living our values allows you to make sure that the choices you are making are in line with them and also recognizing the core values of others and understanding how they effect their choices. Our values are going to effect our life goals, education goals and expectations, and learning style.<br></p>
          <p>
            Empathy for yourself and empathy for others also plays a big role in learning, career, and life. Empathy fosters insight into others, appreciation and understanding of different perspectives and encourages open-mindedness. It is a vital skill for collaboration, relationships and conflict resolution. I think empathy is the basis for forming authentic, caring relationships. Empathy for yourself allows you to practice self-care, to forgive yourself for shortcomings and to provide yourself with the kindness and gentle care needed to continue to learn successfully.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Having empathy and living your values requires your to be self-aware. Having insight into who you are, why you react the ways that you do and what your strengths and limitations are can allow you to make adjustments, improvements and accommodations for your weaknesses. Self-awareness also allows you to advocate for yourself because you are aware of your feelings and needs. When we are aware of ourselves we can better understand ourselves and also reflect upon the ways that others see and understand us. <br>

        <h2>Suprises about Core Learning</h2>
          <p>
            The most surprising thing about the core learning was realizing what a difference meditation makes in my day. I have loved implementing this mindfulness practice.
          </p>
        <h2>Most Challanging Aspect of Core Learning</h2>
          <p>
            The most challenging aspect of core learning has been the amount of time that it takes up, not only to learn but also to reflect. We have so much to learn during foundations and the sheer volume of time that it takes each week is challenging. I also found writing the blog posts to be challenging. Its hard to always find an eloquent way to express learning that is taking place internally and also feels very vulnerable to discuss my feelings, values, and shortcomings with strangers. I really like the focus on self-awareness but feel less content sharing those feelings with others.
          </p>
        <h2>Why is Dev Academy Focusing on Core Learning?</h2>
          <p>
            I think Dev Academy is spending so much time focusing on core learning because it is important to be not only good programmers but to be good human beings. Helping a large number of students every year become self aware and to cultivate empathy for themselves and other is a huge service to not only the students but to our community. Consciousness is only shifted via repetition. So the continued weekly focus on personal growth is key to helping make a permanent shift that will serve us in our relationships both in our personal lives and careers.
          </p>
        <h2> Is Core Learning the Best Use of Our Time?</h2>
          <p>
            To be honest there were a lot of times that learning core has felt like a waste of time. Well, not a waste of time but perhaps not the most productive use of my time when compared to the overwhelming volume of tech learning that needs to be done. However, I think some of that resistance to learning core also comes from a place of discomfort. It isn't easy or comfortable to do this internal work. It challenges us to take a step back, to become aware, to sit with ourselves and our thoughts and feelings and to become aware of our limitations. So in the end I think that the core learning is time well spent. I have taken a huge leap in my life coming to dev academy. I gave up a successful career in order to pursue something that I think will be better and it would be a shame if I didn't also use this time to do the hard, internal work needed to be the best version of myself.
