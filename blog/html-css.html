    <h1>Lets Learn CSS- The <code>position</code> Property</h1>
    <h2>Lets Get Positional!</h2>

      <h2>What is the <code>position</code> property?</h2>
        <p> The CSS position property helps to position elements within your document. There are different position values that you can use but today we are going 
          to focus on:
          <ul>
            <li>Static</li>
            <li>Relative</li>
            <li>Absolute</li>
            <li>Fixed</li>
          </ul>
          Once you have assigned a position property(aka relative, fixed ect) you can then further specify its locationon the page by assigning values for 
          top, bottom, left and right.  If you do not declare a position property then it is by default <code>postion:static;</code>.
          Static positioned elements (aka default elements) are not affected by top/bottom/right/left properties and are positioned according the the
          flow of the page. So how do we move things out of the normal flow? Lets find out!  
           </p>

      <h2>position: relative;</h2>
        <p> Its time for relative positioning.... but relative to what? Turns out this property means it is relative to its <em>normal</em> position. 
        This position is almost exactly like <code>position:static;</code> except you can specify values for top/bottom/left/right. By specifying 
        those values you can adjsut away from the <em>normal</em> position of the element. However, keep in mind this will not move any other elements
        to accomadate the change- so you may find that you have gaps or even cover other elements.

      <h2> position: absolute;</h2>
        <p>
          Are you <em>absolutely</em> sure where you want an element? With <code>position: absolute;</code>you can remove an element from 
          the normal document flow and place an element anywhere on the page by specifying a top/bottom/right/left value. The 
          rest of the page will render as though the element is not there at all. 
          Its important to note that in order to apply <code>position: absolute;</code> to a child element the parent element must have
          <code>position: relative</code>

        </p>

      <h2>position: fixed;</h2>
        <p>
          <code>position:fixed;</code> positions your element relative to the viewport (aka screen). This means that even when you scroll on a page
           the element will stay in the same place regardless of the position of the parent element. Like our other elements you can use top,
            bottom, right, or left to poistion it.  A fixed element is removed from the flow of the document and does not leave a space where it would normally
            have been located. <br>
