      <h1>My Identity, Values and Strengths </h1>
      <h3>24 April 2022</h3>
      <main>

        <h2> My Core Personal Values</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Openness to Experience</li>
          <li>Kindnesss</li>
          <li>Positivity</li>
          <li>Honesty</li>
          <li>Inner Peace</lis>
        </ul>

        <h2> Making Ethical Decisions</h2>
          <p>
            In deciding to come to Dev Academy I encountered an ethical decision to be made. I was going to ask my job for a leave of absence for 5 months while I completed bootcamp. My logic behind that decision was that if I determined that web development was not for me then I would have a job to easily return to. The ethical dilemma arose with determining what I would give as my reason for needing a leave of absence. I could have told them I needed to back to the USA to visit family, that we were taking extended holiday, or any number of made up stories <em> or</em> I could tell them the truth.
            <br><br>
            The risk in telling the truth was that they would not grant me a leave of absence since I was going back to school to take the first steps in a new career. I have had multiple colleagues be given extended leaves to travel back to see family so I was quite certain I would be given leave for that reason. The values I weighed in making this decision was one of security, knowing I would have a job to return to, versus honesty and inner peace. In the end I chose honesty and the consequence of that decision is that I was denied my leave of absence and instead resigned from my position but the additional consequence is that I have inner peace which, to me, is a much better trade off.

        <h2> How My Culture Influences my Identity</h2>
          <p>
            Until now I hadn't really given much thought to my culture or the culture that I grew up in in the USA. Being raised in America has taught me to value diversity and individualism. I was raised being taught that I could be anything, do anything that I wanted if I was willing to work for it. This idea that I have control over my destiny, my decisions and my life has allowed me to be goal-oriented and to go after my dreams and push myself. I grew up in Utah but as an adult I have also lived in Georgia and Texas and now in New Zealand. I have loved being exposed to different cultures, to people who were raised differently than me, look different, think different makes me value diversity even more.

        <h2> My Strengths and Limitations</h2>
        <p>
          In terms of learning and career development my strengths lie in my ability to learn quickly, not give up when faced with difficulty and to get along easily with others. I find connection with other people vital in all areas of my life. I want to get to know my colleagues, my neighbors, the other parents at the school and to be known in return.
          <br><br>
          On that same note one limitation of my personality is that I am very talkative. Having taken the DOPE personality test I am a <em>peacock</em>: Someone who loves talking, has enthusiasm and is happy and optimistic but can be accused of talking to much and are not good with time-control.

        <h2>An Example of Trying to Work Productively with Others When There is Tension or Resistance </h2>
        <p>
          For the past 3 years I have worked closely with a tight-knit group of colleagues. It is a joy to work in such a close group when everyone is flowing together but it can be difficult when there is tension.
          <br><br>
          Over the years I have handled these moments of tension and disconnect in different ways, probably depending on my personal mood at the time. There have been times when the tension is ignored, times when it is directly approached ("Hey what's going on today? are you ok?") or times when we have tried to break the tension (ordering takeaways for lunch, turning up the music, telling funny stories). There have also been instances of grumbling to ourselves or getting frustrated.
          <br><br>
          This questions feels so very close to home when I think back on working in close contact with five women for years on end. I can clearly see when some strategies worked better than others. Approaching the situation with love, compassion and understanding is significantly better than grumbling, getting angry or adding to the tension.
