      <h1> Javascript Fundamentals- The DOM</h1>

      <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is the structure of the webpage- all the content. The CSS is the styling. <br><br>To use a baking analogy: HTML is all the ingredients for our birthday cake- the flour, the sugar, the pan etc. CSS is the decoration- the pipping, the sprinkles, the color of the frosting, the position of the happy birthday message and the pretty cake stand.  

      </p>

      <h2> Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>

      <h2> Data from Arrays and Objects</h2>

      <h2> Functions and Why We Love Them</h2>
      <p>
        A function is a block of code that you designed to perform a particular task. You give your function a name and then you execute or 'call' the function as many times as you need. Functions are our heavy-lifters, rather than having to repeat your code multiple times, you can write a function once and reuse it as often as you need.
        <br>
        Here is an example of a very simple function called <code>sayHello</code> that will print out "hello!" in the console.   
        <br><br>
        <code>function sayHello (){
          <br>
          console.log("hello!")
          <br>
          }
          <br> <br>
          sayHello();</code>
          <br><br>
          So when the function, named <code>sayHello</code>, is called (or executed) "hello!" will print out on the console log.Notice that not only do we need to write the function you also need to <em>call</em> the function. <br><br>
          Functions are very dynamic and can be written to take a paramenter with any data type as the value, they can return a value to you,  you can nest functions inside another function and much more.
