      <h2>HTML and CSS- An Anaolgy</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is the structure of the webpage- all the content. The CSS is the styling. <br><br>To use a baking analogy: HTML is all the ingredients for our birthday cake- the flour, the sugar, the pan etc. CSS is the decorations- the piping, the sprinkles, the color of the frosting, the position of the happy birthday message and the pretty cake stand.

      <h2> Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Control Flow is how your computer runs its code, typically from the top to the bottom. Like reading a book or a recipe, one line at a time from the first line to the last, unless it runs into some code that changes its flow like a <em>loop</em>. <br><br>

        A loop is like a little break out from the flow. It tells the computer to do something over and over again until certain cicrumcstances are met before it can move on with the rest of the code. 
        <br><br>
        Lets use the steps for making a scrambled egg breakfast as an example of our control flow with stirring the eggs as a little loop that temporarily breaks us out of our flow. 
        <ol>
          <li>Put the pan on the stove </li>
          <li>Turn on the stove</li>
          <li>Add oil</li>
          <li>Crack Eggs into a bowl</li>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Stir eggs</li>
          <li>Are they mixed? No</li>
          <li>Stir eggs</li>
          <li>Are they mixed? No</li>
          <li>Stir eggs</li>
          <li>Are they mixed? Yes</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Add Eggs to Pan</li>
          <li>Cook</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
      <p>

      <h2> Data from Arrays and Objects</h2>
      <p>

      </p>

      <h2> Functions and Why We Love Them</h2>
      <p>
        A function is a block of code that you designed to perform a particular task. You give your function a name and then you execute or 'call' the function as many times as you need. Functions are our heavy-lifters, rather than having to repeat your code multiple times, you can write a function once and reuse it as often as you need.
        <br>
        Here is an example of a very simple function called <code>sayHello</code> that will print out "hello!" in the console.   
        <br><br>
        <code>function sayHello (){
          <br>
          console.log("hello!")
          <br>
          }
          <br> <br>
          sayHello();</code>
          <br><br>
          So when the function, named <code>sayHello</code>, is called (or executed) "hello!" will print out on the console log.Notice that not only do we need to write the function you also need to <em>call</em> the function. <br><br>
          Functions are very dynamic and can be written to take a paramenter with any data type as the value, they can return a value to you,  you can nest functions inside another function and much more.
