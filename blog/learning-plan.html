        <h2> Career Goals</h2>
          <p>
            My long term goal continues to be to find a challenging and creative career that gives me freedom and flexibility. I hoping to use the skills I gain during this course to start as an entry level front-end web developer and then continue to grow and learn as I discover the different directions this career and skillset can take me in. I would like to use the the things that I learn to create good things in the world. I am particularly interested in helping animals, children and the environment.
          </p>

        <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            Looking back over my time spent in foundations solidified my earlier assessment of my strengths and weaknesses. One new strength that has emerged is my googling ability- I have been able to solve a lot of problems with google. My biggest strength coming into bootcamp is my high motivation and commitment to becoming a successful programmer. I have made the choice to quit the career I have and pursue a dream that will be better for my family- failing is not an option for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another strength that I have been excited to discover is my curiosity when faced with a problem to be solved- I have really enjoyed the problem solving aspect of programming. When things aren't working right, rather than getting frustrated, I get really curious about why and am excited to solve the problem. However, that also goes hand in hand with one of my biggest limitations at the moment and that is my technical knowledge as well as comparing myself to others. I have no previous programing experience and many people in foundations have computer science or programming backgrounds and I have found that I compare myself to others and their progress when they come from a vastly different background than me. As my technical knowledge grows my ability to creatively problem solve as well as my confidence in my work will grow as well.
          </p>


        <h2>Non-Technical Challenges and Skills</h2>
          <p>
            I think one of the big challenges of bootcamp is going to be staying focused and motivated. Working 60 hour weeks are really draining and I think I will start to feel that particularly in my family life as I wont be around as much. Balancing that intensity of bootcamp with the needs of my little family will be a challenge as the bootcamp wears on. Another thing that will be really new to me is pair programming and collaborating on projects. Although I think this will be a vital skill and something I will enjoy I am sure that it is also a potential source of frustration, particularly when both parties have very surface level understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've spent a lot of time developing my core skills in my career as a nuclear medicine technologist because I dealt with very sick and dying cancer patients every day for a decade. My ability to empathize, to support and understand and care for others during a vulnerable time was a skill that served me well. I have always been someone that is interested in personal growth, meditation, and self improvement so taking the time to incorporate that into my time at DevAcademy is exciting. I would really like to work on my self-awareness, self confidence, creativity and leadership while in bootcamp.
          </p>

        <h2>Expectations</h2>
          <p>
            My expectations of the dev academy team continue to be patience, clear instruction and regular, honest feedback. 
            <!-- I have not received much feedback, positive or negative, in regards to my code during foundations and I would find it useful to receive feedback and critique/ ideas for improvement. I want to write clean, DRY code but would benefit from review of my code so that I am aware of the areas that need change and how improvement can be made. -->
          </p>
          <p>
            My expectations of myself during bootcamp include being to campus on time ready to learn daily. I will get enough sleep at night so that my brain and body are ready to learn each day. I will take small breaks when I'm getting overwhelmed and ask for help as needed. I will treat other students and facilitators with respect and kindness as we collaborate and learn together. I will hand off the majority of my household and childcare tasks to my partner so that I can focus the majority of my time, energy and efforts towards Bootcamp.

          </p>

        <h1> Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2>My Long Term Goals</h2>
          <p>Learning to code has been an aspiration of mine for years and over the past year I took several online classes. I found that, although there is a steep learning curve, I really enjoy it! After working in Nuclear Medicine for the past decade the inflexible work schedule, long hours, risk of bringing Covid home to my family, and inability to work from home made me start to seriously consider a career change into computer programming.

         <br>
         <p>
           I am eager for a challenging, creative career that will give me more freedom and flexibility. Freedom to spend time with those I love and flexibility to do it anywhere in the world. My initial goal is to gain the skills at EDA to start a career as a front-end web developer, long term I am interested in discovering which areas of coding I most enjoy and developing a more specialized skill set. I am potentially interested in specializing in secure coding.
         </p>

          </p>
        <h2>My Strengths and Limitations Concerning Learning</h2>
          <p>When it comes to learning my strengths include positivity, curiosity, self-learning, organization and my ability to relate to others. My biggest limitations are a fear of failure, comparing myself to others and feeling overwhelmed. 
          </p>

        <h2>Human Skills to Develop</h2>
          <p>There are many skills that I am keen to develop while at Dev Academy.

            <ul> 
              <li>I want to learn to <em>think like a programmer</em> and use creativity in my problem solving</li>
              <li>I want to grow my confidence and not compare myself to others</li>
              <li>Graciously and openly receive feedback</li>
              <li>Learn to better collaborate both in-person and while in a remote learning situation</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        <h2>My Commitment to Managing My Workload </h2>
          <p>
          I commit to treat EDA like a full time job. I will maintain a routine and structure to my day to ensure I am able to compete all of my learning competencies and tasks. I will schedule my learning responsibilities as well as my family obligations in my google calendar to ensure no area of my life is being overlooked and use Toggl to make sure I am making the most effective use of my time.
          <br><br>
          I commit to take care of myself so that I am able to learn effectively. This includes daily mediation, taking breaks when I get overwhelmed, reaching out for help, getting enough sleep, exercise and nutritious food and spending time outside every day. 
          <br><br>
          When I begin to feel overwhelmed I will take a step back, take a break and ask for help. Things that work well for me to alleviate stress are: meditating, going for a walk, reading a book and spending some time with family.
          <br><br>
          When I get stuck on difficult concepts I will use my resources from Dev Academy and google to attempt to solve the problem. If I am unable to solve the problem within a reasonable amount of time, 10-15 minutes, I will reach out for help through discord. 
          </p>      

        <h2> My Expectations of the Dev Academy Team</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Regular and honest feedback so that I can continue to grow and learn </li>
          <li>Patience- I will have a lot of questions as I do my best to learn</li>
          <li>Articulate a clear vision and direction for students. I don't know what I dont know so I need a clear path on where my learning needs to go</li>
          <li> Provide oppurtunites and resources to stretch my learning when needed </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scheduling Commitments</h2>
        <p>
          Before 9am is my time to walk the dog, get my daughter ready for school and do school drop-off. I am primarily available from 9am-5pm to be doing Dev Academy work with a lunch break around noon with my husband and schoolpick-up at 3pm. At 5pm I log off for family time and then after my daughter goes to bed at 8pm I am able to do any additional work that wasnt accomplished during 'work hours'.
