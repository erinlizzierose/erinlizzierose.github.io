        <h2>My Long Term Goals</h2>
        <p>Learning to code has been an aspiration of mine for years and over the past year I took several online classes. I found that, although there is a steep learning curve, I really enjoy it! After working in Nuclear Medicine for the past decade the inflexible work schedule, long hours, risk of bringing Covid home to my family, and inability to work from home made me start to seriously consider a career change into computer programming.

         <br><br> I am eager for a challenging, creative career that will give me more freedom and flexibility. Freedom to spend time with those I love and flexibility to do it anywhere in the world. My initial goal is to gain the skills at EDA to start a career as a front-end web developer, long term I am interested in discovering which areas of coding I most enjoy and developing a more specialized skill set. I am potentially interested in specializing in secure coding.

        </p>
        <h2>My Strengths and Limitations Concerning Learning</h2>
        <p>When it comes to learning my strengths include positivity, curiosity, self-learning, organization and my ability to relate to others. My biggest limitations are a fear of failure, comparing myself to others and feeling overwhelmed. 
        </p>

        <h2>Human Skills to Develop</h2>
        <p>There are many skills that I am keen to develop while at Dev Academy.

          <ul> 
            <li>I want to learn to <em>think like a programmer</em> and use creativity in my problem solving</li>
            <li>I want to grow my confidence and not compare myself to others</li>
            <li>Graciously and openly receive feedback</li>
            <li>Learn to better collaborate both in-person and while in a remote learning situation</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>My Commitment to Managing My Workload </h2>
        <p>
          I commit to treat EDA like a full time job. I will maintain a routine and structure to my day to ensure I am able to compete all of my learning competencies and tasks. I will schedule my learning responsibilities as well as my family obligations in my google calendar to ensure no area of my life is being overlooked and use Toggl to make sure I am making the most effective use of my time.
          <br><br>
          I commit to take care of myself so that I am able to learn effectively. This includes daily mediation, taking breaks when I get overwhelmed, reaching out for help, getting enough sleep, exercise and nutritious food and spending time outside every day. 
          <br><br>
          When I begin to feel overwhelmed I will take a step back, take a break and ask for help. Things that work well for me to alleviate stress are: meditating, going for a walk, reading a book and spending some time with family.
          <br><br>
          When I get stuck on difficult concepts I will use my resources from Dev Academy and google to attempt to solve the problem. If I am unable to solve the problem within a reasonable amount of time, 10-15 minutes, I will reach out for help through discord. 
        </p>

        <h2> My Expectations of the Dev Academy Team</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Regular and honest feedback so that I can continue to grow and learn </li>
          <li>Patience- I will have a lot of questions as I do my best to learn</li>
          <li>Articulate a clear vision and direction for students. I don't know what I dont know so I need a clear path on where my learning needs to go</li>
          <li> Provide oppurtunites and resources to stretch my learning when needed </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scheduling Commitments</h2>
        <p>
          Before 9am is my time to walk the dog, get my daughter ready for school and do school drop-off. I am primarily available from 9am-5pm to be doing Dev Academy work with a lunch break around noon with my husband and schoolpick-up at 3pm. At 5pm I log off for family time and then after my daughter goes to bed at 8pm I am able to do any additional work that wasnt accomplished during 'work hours'.
