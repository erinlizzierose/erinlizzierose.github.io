      <h1> Problem Solving </h1>

        <h2>Simple Problems</h2>
          <p>
            Programming, as it turns out, is all about solving problems. I am learning so much about the way I solve problems and the techniques I can use to become a better problem solver.
          </p>
          <p>
             This past week I was very blocked on what turned out to be a very simple problem. I was working through some code on a website called repl.it and I could not get my code to pass the required set of tests. I tried googling, I talked through the program outloud, I had written pseudocode to understand what steps needed to be taken. It was somewhat frustrating because I felt as though I had solved the problem but it wasn't passing the test so something was clearly missing. After exhausting all the methods I could think of I reached out to the facilitators for help. The problem? I had forgotten to <code>return</code> a value!
          </p>
          <p>
            This was such a basic thing to have forgotten in my code. I was assuming I had a fault in my logic or I had incorrectly used the new methods I had learned but I had simply forgotten to hand that value back to my computer. This is kind of like using a calculator to input a bunch of numbers but not getting the total because you forgot to hit the equals button. In the future I'll make sure I have actually returned a value before I spend significant time trying to rewrite my code. 
          </p>

        <h2> Elegant Solutions</h2>
          <p>
            My most elegent solution is not always my first solution. Refactoring is going back through and changing or restructuring existing code without changing what the code does. This past week I was working through some code that wanted to remove a certain word from a sentence. 
          </p>
          <p>  
            The initial way that I wrote the code worked to solve this problem but when I came back to look at it later I realized that a more elegent and simple way to solve the problem would be to use what is called an arrow notation and looks like this: <code>=></code>. 
            This shortened notation allowed me to remove some words from my code and I also refactored the name of my variables. The new code was shorter and easy to read and follow along.
          </p>
          <p>
             Writing code that solves a problem succinctly but also is written beautifully was really satisfying. I am excited to be able to practice writing elegent code in the future even if that means writing it less-elegantly at first and having to go back and refactor. I hope to get better and doing it well the first time in the future.

        <h2>Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
          <p>
            The following are a list of common problem solving techniques and processes used in coding.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode</li>
            <li>Trying something</li>
            <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
            <li>Reading error messages</li>
            <li>Console.logging</li>
            <li>Googling</li>
            <li>Asking peers for help</li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
            <li>Improve your process with reflection</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I feel confident employing all of these methods and had the oppurtunity to use every one of them this past week in Dev Academy. I feel confident that as I learn more coding and in turn have more oppurtunities to practice my problem solving skills that I will improve further. The one method that I feel needs to be improved the most is writing pseudocode. My current pseudocode is too broad and I will practice breaking it down into even smaller problems to be solved.
